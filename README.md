# Unity DataBinding

Data Binding is a unity library that supports binding user interface elements to custom data type (=ViewModel) properties.

Data Binding is easy to use and comes with some simple examples to get started.

This package is a subset of my UnityUtil package migrated to the new package work flow. The package contains the reflection extensions and the original data binding assembly code.
