## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-20

### This is the first release of *unity.databinding*.

This release is a subset of my UnityUtil package migrated to the new package work flow.

This package contains the reflection extensions and the original data binding assembly code bundled into a package.

The release is meant to be used in projects that do not want to include the full package but just want to use the data binding functionality.
